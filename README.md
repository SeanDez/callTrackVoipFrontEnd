### Call Tracker for Voip.ms

#### Currently in pre-alpha status

Call Trackre for Voip.ms is designed to help people who use the Voip.ms service for phone campaigns to assess their results in a nice dashboard interface.

The app pulls call data from your Voip.ms account and gives you performance metrics, including calls per month and per campaign.

If you would like to use this app, be sure to clone and use the back end repository as well, as this front end repo is dependent on it. https://github.com/SeanDez/callTrackVoipBackEnd
